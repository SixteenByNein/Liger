Today, I got the program to find every .lgr file in the folder structure.

I began to prune obsolete code. More work on that front will be requisite. As for the template parser, I have the _match_ to recognize Liger tags set up but awaiting actual function. 

I will say: the program feels a lot cleaner compared to what it was before. Did you ever watch that show _The Red Green Show_? I felt like I had been _rednecking_ everything with duct tape and popsickle sticks. I'm learning a lot about Rust now and I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.

This project is the first one that I've worked on since Microsoft added Copilot to VS Code and I have to say, I'm not a fan. It's making me almost want to switch to Vim. I did install Neovim but I wasn't ready to learn a brand new program today. Maybe tomorrow.

> TO DO:
>- Write logic to check if the target file already exists and either create a new one or clear the old one.
>- Make sure the _external_ tag can see the referenced file.
>- Write main document compilation function.
>- Write dictionary of tags/tutorial.
